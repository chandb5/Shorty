## **Weekly Plan (12 Weeks)**

### **Week 1: Authentication & Infrastructure Setup**
**Focus**: Build the core backend infrastructure and authentication system.

#### Tasks:
1. **Infrastructure Setup with Terraform**:
   - Create an AWS account or configure existing credentials.
   - Set up IAM roles, policies, and permissions for Lambda functions.
   - Deploy basic infrastructure (S3 buckets for static files, DynamoDB table for storing user data).

2. **Backend Development in Go**:
   - Implement a basic authentication system using JWT.
   - Create API endpoints for user registration and login.

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Initialize a React.js project with TypeScript.
   - Set up basic components (e.g., navigation bar, login form).

**Estimated Time**: 10 hours (backend) + 8 hours (frontend) = **18 hours**

### **Week 2: Basic URL Shortening**
**Focus**: Implement the core functionality of shortening URLs.

#### Tasks:
1. **Backend Development**:
   - Create an API endpoint to shorten URLs.
   - Store shortened links in DynamoDB with expiration dates and redirect counts.
   - Add a basic caching layer using Redis (if time permits).

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Build the URL shortening form.
   - Display shortened URLs and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for backend functions.
   - Test frontend components to ensure they interact with the backend correctly.

**Estimated Time**: 10 hours (backend) + 8 hours (frontend) = **18 hours**

---

### **Week 3: Dashboard & Analytics**
**Focus**: Build a basic dashboard for users to view their shortened links' analytics.

#### Tasks:
1. **Backend Development**:
   - Create API endpoints to fetch analytics data (e.g., redirect count, geolocation).
   - Store and retrieve analytics data in DynamoDB or another database.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Build a dashboard component.
   - Display basic analytics (e.g., total redirects, country-wise breakdown).

3. **Testing**:
   - Test API endpoints for accuracy.
   - Ensure the frontend displays data correctly.

**Estimated Time**: 10 hours (backend) + 8 hours (frontend) = **18 hours**

---

### **Week 4: Frontend Development**
**Focus**: Complete the frontend components and integrate them with the backend.

#### Tasks:
1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Implement all remaining UI components.
   - Add error handling for form submissions.
   - Ensure responsive design across devices.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Optimize existing API endpoints.
   - Add logging to track errors and user activity.

3. **Testing**:
   - Perform end-to-end testing.
   - Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.

**Estimated Time**: 10 hours (frontend) + 5 hours (backend) = **15 hours**

---

### **Week 5: Caching & Performance Optimization**
**Focus**: Implement Redis caching and optimize performance.

#### Tasks:
1. **Backend Development**:
   - Integrate Redis to cache frequently accessed links.
   - Optimize DynamoDB queries for better performance.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Add loading states for slower responses.
   - Implement error handling for cached data.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the caching mechanism for accuracy and performance improvements.
   - Ensure the system scales under load (if possible).

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours (backend) + 5 hours (frontend) = **13 hours**

---

### **Week 6: Custom Domains**
**Focus**: Implement custom domain functionality.

#### Tasks:
1. **Backend Development**:
   - Create an API endpoint to handle custom domains.
   - Store and validate custom domains in DynamoDB.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Build a form for users to add custom domains.
   - Display custom domains on the dashboard.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the integration of custom domains with shortened links.
   - Ensure validation works correctly.

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours (backend) + 6 hours (frontend) = **14 hours**

---

### **Weeks 7-9: Analytics & Reporting**
**Focus**: Enhance the analytics dashboard and add detailed reporting features.

#### Tasks:
1. **Backend Development**:
   - Implement advanced analytics (e.g., hourly breakdown, referrer analysis).
   - Create reports in PDF or CSV format for users to download.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Add interactive charts and graphs to the dashboard.
   - Build a report generation component.

3. **Testing**:
   - Validate the accuracy of analytics data.
   - Ensure reports are generated and downloaded correctly.

**Estimated Time**: 10 hours (backend) + 8 hours (frontend) = **18 hours per week**

---

### **Weeks 10-12: Final Testing & Deployment**
**Focus**: Finalize testing, deployment, and documentation.

#### Tasks:
1. **Backend Development**:
   - Implement final optimizations.
   - Add monitoring with AWS CloudWatch.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Ensure the application is fully responsive.
   - Fix any remaining bugs or issues.

3. **Deployment & Documentation**:
   - Deploy the application to production using Terraform.
   - Write documentation for users and administrators.

4. **Final Testing**:
   - Conduct load testing (if possible).
   - Ensure the system handles edge cases gracefully.

### **Total Estimated Time**:
- **Backend**: ~80 hours
- **Frontend**: ~60 hours
- **Testing & Deployment**: ~20 hours
- **Documentation**: ~10 hours
